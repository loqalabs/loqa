# 🦜 Loqa – A Local-First Voice Assistant

**Loqa** is a privacy-respecting, local-first voice assistant platform. It’s designed to be fully functional without the cloud — giving you fast, private, and intelligent voice interaction that runs on your own devices.

Whether you're automating your smart home, talking to a local journaling assistant, or building custom voice tools, Loqa is built to give you full control — with zero Big Tech dependency.

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Natural Voice Control** with Whisper.cpp + Ollama LLM
- 🏠 **Home Assistant Integration** (planned as first major skill)
- 📦 **Modular Skills System** with opt-in extensions
- 🎙️ **Edge Audio Devices ("Pucks")** using ESP32 or test clients
- 🔁 **Event-Driven Architecture** using NATS pub/sub
- 🚫 **Privacy-First by Design** — local-first, no cloud required

## 🚀 Try It Out

Want to launch Loqa locally or set up a dev environment?

👉 **Start here:** [`docs/quickstart.md`](./docs/quickstart.md)

## 🧱 How It Works

Loqa follows a local-first, modular architecture:

1. 🗣️ **Audio Puck** streams voice via gRPC
2. 📝 **Speech-to-Text** via Whisper.cpp
3. 🤖 **Intent Parsing** via LLM (Ollama)
4. 📡 **Commands Published** over NATS
5. 🏠 **Skills or Devices Respond** with actions

> 🎯 It’s like a tiny personal Alexa that runs entirely on your own terms.

## 🧩 Skill System (WIP)

Loqa uses a flexible skill system that allows custom commands, behaviors, and integrations — all locally hosted, with simple metadata and message contracts.

Planned examples:
- 🔌 Home Assistant bridge
- 📓 Journaling / notes
- 🎵 Media playback (local or optional remote)
- 🧠 AI chat / memory assistant

👉 Details in [`docs/skills.md`](./docs/skills.md)

## 💸 Sustainability + Future Plans

Loqa is free and open by default — and it always will be.

That said, building high-quality privacy software takes time, and we want Loqa to be sustainable. In the future, we plan to offer optional **paid features** that support development:

- 📡 Remote access to your system
- ☁️ Cloud backups of settings or skill data
- 🪄 Premium skill packs or dashboards
- 🛠️ Loqa-hosted instances for those who don't want to self-host

These features will be **opt-in**, transparent, and built with the same values of user control and data sovereignty.

> 🤝 Local-first. Values-first. Sustainability through trust.
