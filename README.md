# ü¶ú Loqa ‚Äì A Local-First Voice Assistant

[![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/loqalabs/loqa/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/loqalabs/loqa/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Loqa** is a privacy-respecting voice assistant that runs entirely on your own devices. No cloud, no Big Tech, no data mining ‚Äî just fast, private voice control that you actually own.

> üéØ Think "personal Alexa" that never leaves your house.

## üöÄ Try It Now

**Get running in under 5 minutes with one command:**

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loqalabs/loqa/main/setup.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 to see the voice assistant UI

**For voice testing:** Run `curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loqalabs/loqa/main/test-voice.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash` to test with your microphone, or see the **[5-Minute Setup Guide](./docs/getting-started-5min.md)** for details.

## üèóÔ∏è Setup Options

### üöÄ 5-Minute User Setup (Recommended)

For users who just want to run Loqa quickly with pre-built images:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loqalabs/loqa/main/setup.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash
```

This downloads the docker-compose.yml and uses pre-built Docker images from our CI/CD pipeline - no compilation needed!

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

For developers who want to build from source and modify the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/loqalabs/loqa.git
cd loqa/scripts && ./setup-dev.sh
# OR use Make commands
cd loqa/scripts && make setup-dev
```

This clones all repositories and builds Docker images locally from source.
