# 🌟 Vision

Loqa exists to reclaim voice computing for the people.

> 🧱 This document reflects the vision for Loqa as a platform. The current architecture implements **Loqa Core** — the foundational scaffolding for local-first voice assistants. Core includes audio streaming, intent parsing, skill execution, and arbitration. Innovation vectors like Natural Skill Learning, Conversational Memory, and Multi-Agent Collaboration are planned as post-MVP directions.

We believe voice assistants can be **powerful, private, and personal** — without requiring you to surrender your data to Big Tech. We're building Loqa to prove that privacy-first AI is not only possible, but better.

## 🧠 Local-First by Design

Loqa runs on your own hardware. No always-on cloud listeners, no data slurping, no "opt-out" settings buried in menus.

Everything — from wake word detection to natural language parsing to device control — works locally by default. Your voice, your data, your rules.

## 🔌 Hackable, Extensible, Yours

We’re making a platform that invites **tinkerers**, **makers**, and **developers** to explore new use cases:

- Smart homes without surveillance
- Voice-controlled kiosks and public terminals
- Accessible interfaces for people with disabilities
- Embedded voice controls for robotics or automotive
- Just-for-fun projects that talk back ✨

Loqa should feel more like building with LEGO than deploying a black box.

## 🤝 Built With Kindness

Loqa isn't just about tech — it's about values:

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Inclusion: We welcome everyone, especially those historically marginalized in tech.
- 🐾 Consent: Devices should do what you say — not spy when you don’t.
- 🔍 Transparency: You can inspect every layer of Loqa’s stack. Nothing is hidden behind a Terms of Service wall.

## 🚀 What's Next

We’re starting with home voice control, but that’s just the beginning.

Loqa is a foundation. A privacy-respecting voice layer for whatever you dream up — from personal productivity to public infrastructure.

If you’ve ever said “I wish my voice assistant could do \_\_\_, but I don’t trust it” — this is your moment. Loqa Core is just the beginning. The real Loqa Magic comes next.

Let’s make voice feel human again.
