## Binary Frame Format

All audio and control data between relays and the hub is encoded as a fixed-length binary frame:

```
| type 1B | seq 2B | ts_ms 4B | len 2B | payload ... |
```

- `type`: `0xA1` for uplink PCM16 audio, `0xB1` for downlink audio, `0xC1` for control messages
- `seq`: sequence number
- `ts_ms`: timestamp in milliseconds
- `len`: number of bytes in payload
- Payload is raw PCM16 mono 16kHz or small JSON for control ops

## Tiered Performance Profiles

Loqa supports multiple performance profiles to balance resource usage and responsiveness based on deployment environments:

- **Paranoid Tier (Local-Only)**

  - All processing and data remain strictly on-device.
  - No network calls outside local network.
  - Maximum privacy and data security.
  - Suitable for privacy-sensitive users and offline scenarios.

- **Balanced Tier (Selective Network Access)**

  - Allows selective network calls for enhanced capabilities (e.g., cloud-based LLMs).
  - Privacy controls configurable per skill or service.
  - Suitable for users requiring advanced features with controlled privacy trade-offs.

- **Convenient Tier (Full-Featured)**
  - Full network connectivity enabled for maximum functionality.
  - Supports cloud integrations, remote access, and extensive skill ecosystem.
  - Ideal for users prioritizing convenience and feature richness over strict privacy.

Each tier is enforced via the Hybrid Skills System and network policies, enabling users to tailor Loqa to their privacy and performance preferences.

---

## Intent Parsing Pipeline

Loqa uses a tiered cascade for interpreting user commands, balancing low-latency interaction with natural language flexibility. This pipeline has three main layers _(timing SLAs proposed; must be validated via benchmarks)_:

1. **Reflex Layer**

   - Pattern-based matchers (e.g., regex, command prefix)
   - Fast, deterministic response without invoking an LLM
   - Ideal for "lights on", "volume up", etc.

2. **Local LLM Layer**

   - Local small model (e.g., Llama 3B)
   - Supports paraphrased and shortform natural commands
   - Bound to strict tool usage and command templates

3. **Cloud LLM Layer (Optional)**
   - Large or cloud-based model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)
   - Enables multi-turn conversation, explanation, or complex flows
   - NOT automatically used; must be explicitly invoked as a separate skill
   - Most tiers do NOT include Cloud LLM by default

The TTS system may begin playback (e.g. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶‚Äù) as early as the reflex or local layer, even before final parsing is complete.

Tier selection (`basic`, `standard`, `pro`, `hybrid`) determines which layers are available.

## Intent Parsing: Executable Spec

This section specifies the concrete interfaces, thresholds, and schemas that implement the Reflex ‚Üí Local LLM ‚Üí Cloud LLM cascade. Claude Code and contributors should treat this as **implementation guidance** for MVP.

### Interfaces & Events (NATS subjects)

| Subject                 | Direction | Payload (JSON)                                                            |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| `asr.partial`           | Hub‚ÜíBus   | `{"conversation_id","ts_ms","text","confidence"}`                         |
| `asr.final`             | Hub‚ÜíBus   | same as partial with `final:true`                                         |
| `nlu.intent.candidates` | Hub‚ÜíBus   | `{"conversation_id","source":"reflex                                      | small | large","candidates":[...]}` |
| `nlu.intent.commit`     | Hub‚ÜíBus   | `{"conversation_id","intent":IntentCandidate}`                            |
| `skill.invoke.request`  | Hub‚ÜíBus   | `{"conversation_id","plan_id","step_idx","tool","args"}`                  |
| `skill.invoke.result`   | Skill‚ÜíBus | `{"conversation_id","plan_id","step_idx","ok":bool,"data":{},"error":""}` |

**IntentCandidate schema** (JSON example):

```json
{
  "name": "timer.set",
  "slots": { "duration": "PT5M", "label": "pasta" },
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "explan": "matched reflex pattern 3",
  "requires_confirm": false
}
```

### Reflex Rules (YAML)

Create `reflex.yaml` loaded by the hub:

```yaml
entities:
  builtin:
    duration: { kind: iso8601_duration }
    time: { kind: wallclock }
    room: { kind: enum, values: [kitchen, bedroom, living room] }
rules:
  - name: timer.set
    priority: 100
    patterns:
      - "set (a )?timer for {duration}"
      - "start a {duration} timer( for {label})?"
    slots:
      duration: builtin.duration
      label: { kind: free, optional: true, max_len: 24 }
    confirm_if_ambiguous: true

  - name: lights.on
    priority: 90
    patterns:
      - "(turn|switch) (the )?{room}? lights on"
    slots:
      room: builtin.room
```

**Scoring (default):** Pattern hit (+0.6), entity extraction ok (+0.2), exact synonym (+0.1), prior usage bias (+0.1). The reflex engine returns `IntentCandidate[]` with computed confidences.

### Router Algorithm (pseudo)

_(timing SLAs proposed; must be validated via benchmarks)_

```
on asr.partial(text, conf):
  if reflex.match(text).top.conf >= 0.90:
     commit(intent=top)            // publish nlu.intent.commit
     // opener plays only if commit occurred or confidence >= 0.90
     tts.open("Okay‚Ä¶")            // speak-while-you-think opener
     plan = plan_from_intent(top)
     execute(plan)
     return

  if tier >= standard:
     stream_to_small_llm(text)     // keep accumulating
  else:
     wait for asr.final and then reflex-only

on asr.final(text, conf):
  cand_reflex = reflex.match(text).top
  if cand_reflex.conf >= 0.80:
     commit(cand_reflex); execute(plan_from_intent(cand_reflex)); return

  if tier == standard:
     cand_small = small_llm.parse(text)
     if cand_small.conf >= 0.70: commit(cand_small); execute(...)
     else if tier == pro and allow_cloud:
         cand_large = large_llm.parse(text)
         commit_if(cand_large.conf >= 0.70)
     else prompt_for_clarification()

timeouts:
  small_llm.first_tokens_by <= 250ms
  large_llm.first_tokens_by <= 400ms (if used)
  total TTFB budget (Standard) <= 350ms with opener
```

### Confidence Thresholds (defaults)

- `reflex.commit ‚â• 0.90` on partials; `‚â• 0.80` on finals
- `small_llm.commit ‚â• 0.70`
- `large_llm.commit ‚â• 0.70`
- `requires_confirm: true` if 0.55‚Äì0.70 ‚Üí hub asks: _‚Äú5 minutes, right?‚Äù_

### Plan / Tool-Use Schema (LLM output)

Small/large LLMs **must** emit this JSON (function-call style):

```json
{
  "plan_id": "uuid",
  "can_stream": true,
  "steps": [
    { "tool": "timer.set", "args": { "duration": "PT5M", "label": "pasta" } },
    { "tool": "timer.announce_eta", "args": { "duration": "PT5M" } }
  ]
}
```

- Each `tool` maps to a **Skill signature** (Go or MCP).
- The hub executes steps sequentially, publishing `skill.invoke.request/result`.
- If a step fails and `requires_confirm`, the hub asks the user; otherwise aborts.

#### Skill Signature Contract

Each skill declares a JSON schema (example):

```json
{
  "name": "timer.set",
  "args_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "duration": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^P(T.*)$" },
      "label": { "type": "string", "maxLength": 24 }
    },
    "required": ["duration"]
  }
}
```

The hub validates `args_schema` before invoking a tool.

### ‚ÄúSpeak-While-You-Think‚Äù TTS

- Preload openers in RAM: `["Okay,", "Sure,", "On it,"]`.
- When `nlu.intent.commit` fires, send `tts.start(opener)` immediately.
- Stream the rest once the `plan` is ready; if the plan changes, send `tts.stop(opener_play_id)`.

### Barge-in / Cancel Intents

- Phrases: ‚Äústop‚Äù, ‚Äúcancel‚Äù, ‚Äúnevermind‚Äù ‚Üí `system.cancel` at **highest priority**.
- On cancel: stop current `AssistantResponse`; pause/resume lower categories per ADR‚Äë0005.

### Tier Mapping (performance)

| Tier     | Layers enabled                        | Notes (timing SLAs proposed; must be validated via benchmarks) |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic    | Reflex only (LLM is opt-in)           | No cloud; opener ok                                            |
| Standard | Reflex + Local LLM                    | Target TTFB ‚â§ 250ms                                            |
| Pro      | Reflex + Local LLM + (optional) Cloud | Use if conf is low                                             |
| Hybrid   | Same as Pro with cloud allowed        | User opt‚Äëin only                                               |

### Telemetry (must-have)

- `intent_reflex_hits`, `intent_reflex_conf_avg`
- `small_llm_latency_ms`, `large_llm_latency_ms`
- `intent_commit_source` distribution
- `ttfb_ms` (wake_end ‚Üí first TTS frame)
- `clarification_rate`

### Test Matrix (acceptance)

- Timer: ‚Äúset a 5 minute timer‚Äù (reflex) ‚Üí commit < 100ms
- Lights: ‚Äúmake it cozy‚Äù (small LLM) ‚Üí commit < 250ms
- Ambiguous: ‚Äúset a timer‚Äù ‚Üí confirmation prompt within 500ms
- Cancel during response ‚Üí stop within 100ms

## Tiered Performance Profiles

Loqa supports multiple performance profiles to balance resource usage and responsiveness based on deployment environments:

- **Paranoid Tier (Local-Only)**

  - All processing and data remain strictly on-device.
  - No network calls outside local network.
  - Maximum privacy and data security.
  - Suitable for privacy-sensitive users and offline scenarios.

- **Balanced Tier (Selective Network Access)**

  - Allows selective network calls for enhanced capabilities (e.g., cloud-based LLMs).
  - Privacy controls configurable per skill or service.
  - Suitable for users requiring advanced features with controlled privacy trade-offs.

- **Convenient Tier (Full-Featured)**
  - Full network connectivity enabled for maximum functionality.
  - Supports cloud integrations, remote access, and extensive skill ecosystem.
  - Ideal for users prioritizing convenience and feature richness over strict privacy.

Each tier is enforced via the skills system and network policies, enabling users to tailor Loqa to their privacy and performance preferences.

## Intent Parsing Pipeline

Loqa uses a tiered cascade for interpreting user commands, balancing low-latency interaction with natural language flexibility. This pipeline has three main layers _(timing SLAs proposed; must be validated via benchmarks)_:

1. **Reflex Layer**

   - Pattern-based matchers (e.g., regex, command prefix)
   - Fast, deterministic response without invoking an LLM
   - Ideal for "lights on", "volume up", etc.

2. **Local LLM Layer**

   - Local small model (e.g., Llama 3B)
   - Supports paraphrased and shortform natural commands
   - Bound to strict tool usage and command templates

3. **Cloud LLM Layer (Optional)**
   - Large or cloud-based model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)
   - Enables multi-turn conversation, explanation, or complex flows
   - NOT automatically used; must be explicitly invoked as a separate skill
   - Most tiers do NOT include Cloud LLM by default

The TTS system may begin playback (e.g. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶‚Äù) as early as the reflex or local layer, even before final parsing is complete.

Tier selection (`basic`, `standard`, `pro`, `hybrid`) determines which layers are available.

## Intent Parsing: Executable Spec

This section specifies the concrete interfaces, thresholds, and schemas that implement the Reflex ‚Üí Local LLM ‚Üí Cloud LLM cascade. Claude Code and contributors should treat this as **implementation guidance** for MVP.

### Interfaces & Events (NATS subjects)

| Subject                 | Direction | Payload (JSON)                                                            |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| `asr.partial`           | Hub‚ÜíBus   | `{"conversation_id","ts_ms","text","confidence"}`                         |
| `asr.final`             | Hub‚ÜíBus   | same as partial with `final:true`                                         |
| `nlu.intent.candidates` | Hub‚ÜíBus   | `{"conversation_id","source":"reflex                                      | small | large","candidates":[...]}` |
| `nlu.intent.commit`     | Hub‚ÜíBus   | `{"conversation_id","intent":IntentCandidate}`                            |
| `skill.invoke.request`  | Hub‚ÜíBus   | `{"conversation_id","plan_id","step_idx","tool","args"}`                  |
| `skill.invoke.result`   | Skill‚ÜíBus | `{"conversation_id","plan_id","step_idx","ok":bool,"data":{},"error":""}` |

**IntentCandidate schema** (JSON example):

```json
{
  "name": "timer.set",
  "slots": { "duration": "PT5M", "label": "pasta" },
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "explan": "matched reflex pattern 3",
  "requires_confirm": false
}
```

### Reflex Rules (YAML)

Create `reflex.yaml` loaded by the hub:

```yaml
entities:
  builtin:
    duration: { kind: iso8601_duration }
    time: { kind: wallclock }
    room: { kind: enum, values: [kitchen, bedroom, living room] }
rules:
  - name: timer.set
    priority: 100
    patterns:
      - "set (a )?timer for {duration}"
      - "start a {duration} timer( for {label})?"
    slots:
      duration: builtin.duration
      label: { kind: free, optional: true, max_len: 24 }
    confirm_if_ambiguous: true

  - name: lights.on
    priority: 90
    patterns:
      - "(turn|switch) (the )?{room}? lights on"
    slots:
      room: builtin.room
```

**Scoring (default):** Pattern hit (+0.6), entity extraction ok (+0.2), exact synonym (+0.1), prior usage bias (+0.1). The reflex engine returns `IntentCandidate[]` with computed confidences.

### Router Algorithm (pseudo)

_(timing SLAs proposed; must be validated via benchmarks)_

```
on asr.partial(text, conf):
  if reflex.match(text).top.conf >= 0.90:
     commit(intent=top)            // publish nlu.intent.commit
     // opener plays only if commit occurred or confidence >= 0.90
     tts.open("Okay‚Ä¶")            // speak-while-you-think opener
     plan = plan_from_intent(top)
     execute(plan)
     return

  if tier >= standard:
     stream_to_small_llm(text)     // keep accumulating
  else:
     wait for asr.final and then reflex-only

on asr.final(text, conf):
  cand_reflex = reflex.match(text).top
  if cand_reflex.conf >= 0.80:
     commit(cand_reflex); execute(plan_from_intent(cand_reflex)); return

  if tier == standard:
     cand_small = small_llm.parse(text)
     if cand_small.conf >= 0.70: commit(cand_small); execute(...)
     else if tier == pro and allow_cloud:
         cand_large = large_llm.parse(text)
         commit_if(cand_large.conf >= 0.70)
     else prompt_for_clarification()

timeouts:
  small_llm.first_tokens_by <= 250ms
  large_llm.first_tokens_by <= 400ms (if used)
  total TTFB budget (Standard) <= 350ms with opener
```

### Confidence Thresholds (defaults)

- `reflex.commit ‚â• 0.90` on partials; `‚â• 0.80` on finals
- `small_llm.commit ‚â• 0.70`
- `large_llm.commit ‚â• 0.70`
- `requires_confirm: true` if 0.55‚Äì0.70 ‚Üí hub asks: _‚Äú5 minutes, right?‚Äù_

### Plan / Tool-Use Schema (LLM output)

Small/large LLMs **must** emit this JSON (function-call style):

```json
{
  "plan_id": "uuid",
  "can_stream": true,
  "steps": [
    { "tool": "timer.set", "args": { "duration": "PT5M", "label": "pasta" } },
    { "tool": "timer.announce_eta", "args": { "duration": "PT5M" } }
  ]
}
```

- Each `tool` maps to a **Skill signature** (Go plugin).
- The hub executes steps sequentially, publishing `skill.invoke.request/result`.
- If a step fails and `requires_confirm`, the hub asks the user; otherwise aborts.

#### Skill Signature Contract

Each skill declares a JSON schema (example):

```json
{
  "name": "timer.set",
  "args_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "duration": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^P(T.*)$" },
      "label": { "type": "string", "maxLength": 24 }
    },
    "required": ["duration"]
  }
}
```

The hub validates `args_schema` before invoking a tool.

### ‚ÄúSpeak-While-You-Think‚Äù TTS

- Preload openers in RAM: `["Okay,", "Sure,", "On it,"]`.
- When `nlu.intent.commit` fires, send `tts.start(opener)` immediately.
- Stream the rest once the `plan` is ready; if the plan changes, send `tts.stop(opener_play_id)`.

### Barge-in / Cancel Intents

- Phrases: ‚Äústop‚Äù, ‚Äúcancel‚Äù, ‚Äúnevermind‚Äù ‚Üí `system.cancel` at **highest priority**.
- On cancel: stop current `AssistantResponse`; pause/resume lower categories per ADR‚Äë0005.

### Tier Mapping (performance)

| Tier     | Layers enabled                        | Notes (timing SLAs proposed; must be validated via benchmarks) |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic    | Reflex only (LLM is opt-in)           | No cloud; opener ok                                            |
| Standard | Reflex + Local LLM                    | Target TTFB ‚â§ 250ms                                            |
| Pro      | Reflex + Local LLM + (optional) Cloud | Use if conf is low                                             |
| Hybrid   | Same as Pro with cloud allowed        | User opt‚Äëin only                                               |

### Telemetry (must-have)

- `intent_reflex_hits`, `intent_reflex_conf_avg`
- `small_llm_latency_ms`, `large_llm_latency_ms`
- `intent_commit_source` distribution
- `ttfb_ms` (wake_end ‚Üí first TTS frame)
- `clarification_rate`

### Test Matrix (acceptance)

- Timer: ‚Äúset a 5 minute timer‚Äù (reflex) ‚Üí commit < 100ms
- Lights: ‚Äúmake it cozy‚Äù (small LLM) ‚Üí commit < 250ms
- Ambiguous: ‚Äúset a timer‚Äù ‚Üí confirmation prompt within 500ms
- Cancel during response ‚Üí stop within 100ms
