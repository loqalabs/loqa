# üîß DIY Hardware Guide

Loqa is designed to be **DIY-friendly and community-driven**. We provide specifications, firmware, and support for building your own voice assistant hardware rather than manufacturing devices ourselves.

> **üõ†Ô∏è Our Philosophy**: We believe in empowering the community to build, modify, and improve hardware designs. While we may support specific chips (like ESP32) and collaborate with existing hardware (like the Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition), the goal is to keep Loqa accessible to makers and developers who want to create their own devices.

This guide covers puck hardware specifications, assembly instructions, and embedded development for DIY builders.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [ESP-IDF v5.1+](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/get-started/)
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) (optional, but recommended)
- USB-C cable for programming

### Building Firmware

```bash
# Clone firmware repository
git clone https://github.com/loqalabs/loqa-puck
cd loqa-puck/firmware

# Configure ESP-IDF
. $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh

# Build and flash
idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

### PlatformIO Development

```bash
# Using PlatformIO
cd loqa-puck/firmware
pio run --target upload
pio device monitor
```

## Configuration

### WiFi Setup

Pucks support WiFi provisioning via:
1. **Web Portal**: Access point mode for initial setup
2. **WPS**: Push-button WiFi connection
3. **Hardcoded**: Compile-time credentials (development)

### Runtime Configuration

```c
// Configuration stored in NVS (Non-Volatile Storage)
typedef struct {
    char wifi_ssid[32];
    char wifi_password[64]; 
    char hub_hostname[64];
    uint16_t hub_port;
    float wake_threshold;
    bool debug_mode;
} puck_config_t;
```
