### ü™™ Feature Tiering & Licensing
_This section adds structured feature tiers to clearly distinguish between free open-source capabilities and licensed premium functionality._

- [ ] Create `FEATURE_TIERS.md` (OSS / Licensed / Coming Soon)
- [ ] Tag source with `// OSS_ONLY` or `// LICENSED_FEATURE`
- [ ] CLI: Add `loqa features` command to print current tier
