---

### üßπ MVP Cleanup & Scope
_These items serve as guardrails and structural decisions to maintain clarity and focus for the OSS MVP and prepare for future plugin sandboxing and licensing._

---

### ü™™ Feature Tiering & Licensing
_This section adds structured feature tiers to clearly distinguish between free open-source capabilities and licensed premium functionality._

- [ ] Create `FEATURE_TIERS.md` (OSS / Licensed / Coming Soon)
- [ ] Tag source with `// OSS_ONLY` or `// LICENSED_FEATURE`
- [ ] CLI: Add `loqa features` command to print current tier

---

### üß∫ Shopping List Sync (Paid Feature)
_This section outlines a privacy-preserving, cloud-assisted mobile sync feature for shopping lists ‚Äî designed as a showcase paid-tier skill._

- [ ] Create shopping-list skill with local SQLite persistence
- [ ] Add gRPC and HTTP API endpoints for list manipulation
- [ ] Define encrypted sync blob format (JSON + age or AES-GCM)
- [ ] Build ephemeral QR-based pairing system (Hub ‚Üî Mobile)
- [ ] Implement Loqa Relay microservice (stateless E2EE message routing)

- [ ] Build minimal PWA or native mobile app to sync and view list
- [ ] Gate feature behind `config.license` or `--paid` flag
- [ ] Add Observer UI component to manage sync status and pairing
---

### üß≠ Messaging & Positioning
_These tasks focus on refining external messaging, public perception, and product framing to better communicate the platform‚Äôs value and positioning._

- [ ] Emphasize "HIPAA-conscious by design" in docs and landing
- [ ] Add homepage tagline: "A voice assistant that does more than 'turn on the lights'"
- [ ] Add privacy log policy to README: no voice storage, ephemeral logs, transcript redaction
- [ ] Clarify ‚Äúvoice assistant‚Äù vs ‚Äúvoice platform‚Äù
- [ ] Improve messaging across README, SPONSOR.md, homepage
- [ ] Write short pitches tailored to developers, privacy users, smart home fans
- [ ] UX test homepage messaging with real users
