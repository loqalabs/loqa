## Description


## Original Thought

Implement intelligent retry system with exponential backoff for MCP operations that handles transient failures. Distinguish between retryable errors and permanent failures for seamless user experience.

## Additional Context

## Detailed Description

Current state: MCP operations fail immediately on transient errors like network timeouts, file system locks, or temporary resource unavailability, creating a poor user experience where they have to manually retry commands. Desired end state: Intelligent retry system that automatically handles transient failures with exponential backoff, distinguishes between retryable vs permanent errors, and provides seamless operation where users don't experience temporary failures.

**Related GitHub Issue:** #109

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Acceptance criteria: 1) Retry system identifies retryable vs permanent errors correctly 2) Exponential backoff with jitter prevents thundering herd problems 3) Configurable retry policies for different operation types 4) Maximum retry limits prevent infinite loops 5) Comprehensive logging of retry attempts with timing 6) Integration with existing error handling without breaking changes 7) Performance testing shows minimal overhead for successful operations 8) Circuit breaker pattern implementation to fail fast when services are down

## Dependencies

- No critical dependencies or blockers. Can be developed independently with current MCP server codebase. Would complement the file streaming task well since both improve system reliability. No prerequisite work needed - existing error handling can be enhanced incrementally. Testing can leverage current MCP operations for validation.
