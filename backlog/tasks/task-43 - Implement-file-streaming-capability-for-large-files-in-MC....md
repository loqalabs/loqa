## Description


## Original Thought

Implement file streaming capability for large files in MCP server to prevent token budget violations when reading large files. Create intelligent chunking based on file type and content structure.

## Additional Context

## Detailed Description

The current state is that our MCP server can fail when reading very large files because they exceed Claude's token limits. Users get frustrated when file operations fail on large codebases. The desired end state is intelligent file streaming that automatically chunks large files while preserving code structure, so users never encounter token limit errors and can work with files of any size seamlessly.

**Related GitHub Issue:** #107

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Acceptance criteria: 1) File streaming handles files larger than Claude's token limits without errors 2) Intelligent chunking preserves code structure (functions, classes, etc. aren't split mid-definition) 3) Performance testing shows no degradation for normal-sized files 4) Comprehensive error handling for various file types (text, binary, encoded) 5) Documentation and examples available for developers 6) Integration tests cover large file scenarios with different file types

## Dependencies

- No critical dependencies or blockers. This can be developed independently. However, it would benefit from completing the retry system task in parallel since both improve MCP reliability. Testing will be easier once we have comprehensive error handling in place. No prerequisite work needed - can start immediately with the current MCP server codebase.
