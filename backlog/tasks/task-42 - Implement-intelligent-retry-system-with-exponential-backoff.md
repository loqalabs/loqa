## Description

Create retry system for MCP operations that handles transient failures with exponential backoff. Distinguish between retryable errors and permanent failures for seamless user experience.

**Related GitHub Issue:** #109

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Retry system identifies retryable vs permanent errors,Exponential backoff with jitter prevents thundering herd,Configurable retry policies for different operations,Maximum retry limits prevent infinite loops,Comprehensive logging of retry attempts,Integration with existing error handling,Performance testing shows minimal overhead,Circuit breaker pattern implementation
<!-- AC:END -->
