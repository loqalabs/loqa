## Description

Intelligent failure logging that provides actionable debugging information while maintaining zero-trust privacy guarantees. Store failure context without sensitive content.

## Implementation Notes

GitHub Issue: https://github.com/loqalabs/loqa/issues/49 - Architecture Decision: Security-Aware Observability for Intent Debugging

### Research: Claude Trace
Check out Claude Trace for debugging workflow inspiration:
- **Repository**: https://github.com/badlogic/lemmy/tree/main/apps/claude-trace
- **Demo Video**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu3VDVzAVaE&t=636s (timestamp 10:36)
- **Relevance**: Demonstrates innovative approaches to debugging workflows that could inform our privacy-preserving failure debugging implementation for Loqa
- **Potential Applications**: Could inspire techniques for capturing actionable debugging context while maintaining security boundaries
