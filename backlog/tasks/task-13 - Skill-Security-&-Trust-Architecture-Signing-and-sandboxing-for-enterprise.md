## Description

Implement comprehensive security architecture for Loqa's hybrid skills system, covering both Go plugins and MCP servers. This includes skill-level permissions (trust zones), WASM or subprocess sandboxing for plugins, MCP server process isolation, and skill approval workflows for enterprise deployments.

## Updated Scope: Hybrid Skills Security

With the evolution to support Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers alongside Go plugins, this security architecture must address:

### Go Plugin Security (Existing)
- WASM or subprocess sandboxing for compiled plugins
- Skill-level permissions and trust zones
- Code signing and verification for plugin integrity

### MCP Server Security (New)
- Process isolation for MCP server execution
- Network policy controls for MCP server communication
- Authentication and authorization for MCP tool calls
- Resource limits and monitoring for MCP processes
- Secure configuration management for MCP endpoints

### Unified Security Framework
- Consistent permission model across both skill types
- Enterprise approval workflows for both Go plugins and MCP servers
- Security audit trails for all skill executions
- Trust level classification system (system, verified, community, unknown)

## Implementation Considerations

- MCP servers run as separate processes, providing natural isolation boundary
- Go plugins require additional sandboxing mechanisms (WASM/subprocess)
- Security policies must be configurable for enterprise environments
- Real-time monitoring and alerting for suspicious skill behavior
