## Description

Parse compound utterances (e.g., 'Turn off the lights and play music'), route sub-intents to appropriate skills in sequence, combine TTS responses.
## Implementation Notes

MOVED: This task has been moved to loqa-hub/task-4 for proper service ownership. Intent parsing and LLM processing logic is implemented in the hub service. GitHub Issue: https://github.com/loqalabs/loqa-hub/issues/27
