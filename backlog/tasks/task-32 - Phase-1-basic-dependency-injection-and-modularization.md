# Phase 1: Basic dependency injection and modularization

## Feature Overview
**Feature Name:** Phase 1: Basic dependency injection and modularization

**Component(s):** MCP server architecture improvement (CONDITIONAL)
- [ ] loqa-hub
- [ ] loqa-commander  
- [ ] loqa-relay
- [ ] loqa-proto
- [ ] loqa-skills
- [ ] www-loqalabs-com
- [x] loqa-assistant-mcp (MCP server)

**Priority:** Low (CONDITIONAL - only if Task 033 validation shows success)

**Estimated Effort:** Large (40-60 hours)

## User Story
**As a** developer maintaining the MCP server
**I want** better modularization with dependency injection
**So that** the codebase is more maintainable and testable for future growth

## Business Context
**⚠️ CONDITIONAL TASK**: Only proceed if Task 033 validation shows the file split was highly successful and team wants further modularization. This is Phase 1 of the workflow redesign - more substantial architecture work.

## Functional Requirements
- [ ] Basic dependency injection container for MCP tools
- [ ] Interface-based design for major components
- [ ] Improved testability with mock injection
- [ ] Maintain all existing MCP functionality
- [ ] CLI equivalency for headless operation

## Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance: [specific performance requirements]
- [ ] Security: [security considerations]
- [ ] Scalability: [scalability requirements]
- [ ] Compatibility: [compatibility requirements]

## Technical Design
### Architecture Overview
Basic dependency injection using TypeScript interfaces and simple container pattern

### Key Components
- Tool registry with interface-based registration
- Basic service locator for dependency resolution
- Mock-friendly interfaces for testing
- CLI/MCP dual interface pattern

### Implementation Strategy
1. Extract interfaces from existing split files
2. Create simple DI container
3. Refactor tool registration to use DI
4. Add CLI command equivalents
5. Improve test coverage

### Dependencies
Minimal - avoid heavy DI frameworks, use TypeScript features

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **GATE**: Validate Task 033 shows file split success
- [ ] Extract interfaces from the 5 split files
- [ ] Create basic dependency injection container
- [ ] Implement tool registry with DI
- [ ] Add CLI command equivalents for MCP functions
- [ ] Refactor existing code to use DI pattern
- [ ] Improve test coverage with mockable interfaces
- [ ] Performance validation (ensure no regression)

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] End-to-end tests
- [ ] Performance testing (if applicable)
- [ ] Security testing (if applicable)

## Documentation Requirements
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] User documentation created/updated
- [ ] Developer documentation updated
- [ ] README updates

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Design review completed
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Security review (if applicable)
- [ ] Performance testing passed (if applicable)
- [ ] Quality check passed: `make quality-check`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **PREREQUISITE**: Task 033 validation shows file split highly successful
- [ ] Basic DI container implemented without external dependencies
- [ ] All MCP functionality works through DI pattern
- [ ] CLI equivalency provides headless operation
- [ ] Test coverage improved with mockable interfaces
- [ ] No performance regression from DI overhead
- [ ] Team finds the architecture more maintainable

## Launch Plan
- [ ] Feature flag configuration (if applicable)
- [ ] Rollout strategy defined
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

## Related Issues
- GitHub Issue: #[TBD - only create if Task 033 validation passes]
- **BLOCKED BY**: Task 033 (validation must show file split success)
- Dependencies: Task 027 (file split), Task 030 (size enforcement)
- Part of: Workflow redesign Phase 1 (conditional advancement)
