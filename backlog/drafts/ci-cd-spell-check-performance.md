# Technical Thought: CI/CD Spell Check Performance Issue

## Issue Description

CI/CD spell check workflow in the loqa repo is taking too long to complete.

## Context

This performance issue was identified during development workflow analysis. The spell checking process in the continuous integration pipeline may be affecting development velocity.

## Impact

- Slower CI/CD pipeline execution
- Potential impact on developer productivity
- Delayed feedback on commits

## Investigation Areas

- Review current spell check configuration
- Analyze spell check file scope and patterns
- Consider incremental/cached spell checking
- Evaluate alternative spell check tools or configurations

## Notes

This thought was captured during MCP server troubleshooting. The MCP server is successfully connected but tools are not properly exposed to Claude Code CLI yet.
