## Content
MCP comprehensive task creation system has multiple critical bugs: 1) Filename truncation cutting off words mid-sentence, 2) Generic template population instead of using detailed interview specifications, 3) Inconsistent repository targeting creating duplicates across all repos, 4) Poor filename generation with double dashes and irregular patterns. These bugs make the comprehensive task creation system largely unusable for production workflow. Need to investigate the TypeScript codebase to identify the root causes in filename generation, template population, and repository distribution logic.
