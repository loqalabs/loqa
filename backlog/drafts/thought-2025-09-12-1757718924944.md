## Content
MCP comprehensive task creation system had intermittent failures requiring manual restarts. The interview system would lose context mid-conversation, requiring use of task_ContinueDevelopment to resume. This happened consistently during Phase A task creation, suggesting either: 1) Interview session timeout/expiration issues, 2) State management problems in the MCP server, 3) Context handling bugs in the interview system. Need to investigate interview session persistence and error handling.
